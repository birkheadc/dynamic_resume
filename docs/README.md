# Dynamic Resume
This is my dynamic resume website, which builds my resume into a one-page, printable pdf for me using a combination of static and dynamic content.

The root page contains a form for providing options; language and target-audience mostly. Based on the options selected, the page builds a url, and the resume is built based on that url.

## Points to keep in mind

The resume should be created not only with its electronic form in mind, but also how it will look on paper once printed. To that end, I'm debating whether to have a "printable" version that is different than the on-screen version, or just format the on-screen version to look good printed. I'm leaning toward the latter.

- The printed version has margins. My last resume used a banner at the top that ran up to the left, top, and right edges of the page; but this didn't look so great printed.

- Unless the printer is pretty high-end, color and greyscale don't always look good in print. #000000 black and #ffffff white should be the only 2 colors used. 50% grey might be useable **sparingly**.
